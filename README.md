## Compatibility

- Laravel Nova 4.x and 5.x
- PHP > = 8.0 up To 8.4
- Laravel >=9.x up to 12.x


## Installation

You can install the package in Laravel Nova app that uses Nova via composer:

```bash
composer require elshaden/popup-card
```

## Package Registration

The package will be automatically registered using Laravel's package auto-discovery. However, if you have disabled auto-discovery, you need to manually register the package's service provider in your `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Elshaden\PopupCard\CardServiceProvider::class,
],
```

## Configuration
You can publish the config file with:
```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Elshaden\PopupCard\CardServiceProvider" --tag="popup-card-config"
```

### Database Table Configuration
The package allows you to customize the database table names and foreign keys used by the popup card system. This is useful if you need to avoid table name conflicts or follow specific naming conventions in your application.

Available configuration options:

```php
// config/popup_card.php

// The name of the main table for popup cards
'table_name' => 'popup_cards',

// The name of the pivot table between users and popup cards
'pivot_table' => 'cards_users',

// The foreign key for the user in the pivot table
'user_foreign_key' => 'user_id',

// The foreign key for the popup card in the pivot table
'popup_card_foreign_key' => 'popup_card_id',
```

#### Example: Customizing Table Names

If you want to use custom table names, you can modify these values in your published configuration file:

```php
// config/popup_card.php

// Use a custom table name for popup cards
'table_name' => 'my_custom_popup_cards',

// Use a custom pivot table name
'pivot_table' => 'my_custom_popup_card_user',
```

After changing these values, make sure to run the migrations to create the tables with your custom names.

## Migrations
You can publish the migration with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Elshaden\PopupCard\CardServiceProvider" --tag="popup-card-migrations"
```

After publishing the migration, you can create the necessary database tables by running the migrations:

```bash 
php artisan migrate
```

This will create two tables:
- `popup_cards`: Stores all your popup cards with their content and settings
- `cards_users`: Pivot table that tracks which users have seen which popup cards




## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Add the Trait to Your User Model**

You **MUST** add the `HasPopupCards` trait to your user model. This enables tracking which users have seen which popups:

```php
use Elshaden\PopupCard\Traits\HasPopupCards;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasPopupCards;
    
    // rest of your model...
}
```

2. **Register the Resource in Nova's Menu**

Add the PopupCard resource to your Nova menu to manage popup cards:

```php
use Elshaden\PopupCard\Nova\PopupCardResource;

Nova::mainMenu(function (Request $request) {
    return [
        // Other menu items...
        MenuItem::resource(PopupCardResource::class),
        // More menu items...
    ];
});
```

### Adding Popup Cards to Pages

You can add popup cards to your dashboard or any resource page. The popup will automatically display when users visit that page.

> **Important**: The name you use in the `->name()` method must match the name of an existing popup card in your database. You need to create the popup card first using the Nova admin panel before you can display it in your code.

#### Dashboard Example

```php
use Elshaden\PopupCard\PopupCard;

public function cards(Request $request)
{
    return [
        // Other cards...
        (new PopupCard())->name('welcome-message')->width('1/2'),
    ];
}
```
In this example, a popup card with the name "welcome-message" must already exist in your database.

#### Resource Example

```php
use Elshaden\PopupCard\PopupCard;

public function cards(Request $request)
{
    return [
        // Other cards...
        (new PopupCard())->name('user-instructions')->width('1/3'),
    ];
}
```
Similarly, a popup card with the name "user-instructions" must already exist in your database.

### Customizing Display Conditions

You can control who sees the popup using Nova's `canSee()` method:

```php
use Elshaden\PopupCard\PopupCard;

public function cards(Request $request)
{
    return [
        // Other cards...
        (new PopupCard())
            ->name('2fa-reminder')
            ->width('1/3')
            ->canSee(function () use ($request) {
                // Only show to users without 2FA enabled
                return !$request->user()->hasTwoFactorEnabled();
            }),
    ];
}
```

In this example, a popup card with the name "2fa-reminder" must already exist in your database. This popup would only be shown to users who don't have two-factor authentication enabled.

### Width Options

You can customize the width of your popup card using one of these options:
- `'1/4'` - 25% of screen width
- `'1/3'` - 33% of screen width
- `'1/2'` - 50% of screen width
- `'2/3'` - 66% of screen width
- `'3/4'` - 75% of screen width
- `'full'` - 100% of screen width


### How It Works: Complete Workflow

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the popup card system works:

1. **Create a Popup Card in Nova Admin Panel**
   - Navigate to the PopupCard resource in your Nova admin panel
   - Click "Create Popup Card"
   - Fill in the required fields:
     - **Name**: A unique identifier (e.g., "2fa-reminder") - this is crucial!
     - **Title**: The title displayed at the top of the popup
     - **Body**: The content of the popup (supports HTML)
   - Set "Published" and "Active" to true
   - Save the popup card

2. **Reference the Popup Card in Your Code**
   - In your dashboard or resource file, add the PopupCard to the cards method
   - Use the **exact same name** you specified in the admin panel:
     ```php
     (new PopupCard())->name('2fa-reminder')->width('1/3')
     ```
   - Optionally add conditions using `canSee()` to control who sees the popup

3. **User Experience**
   - When a user visits the page, the system checks if there's an active popup card with the specified name
   - If found and the user hasn't seen it before, the popup is displayed
   - The user can close the popup or choose not to see it again

This name-based reference system allows you to create different popup cards for different parts of your application and control them centrally through the Nova admin panel.


### Managing Popup Cards

Using the PopupCard resource in Nova, you can:
- Create new popup cards with custom titles and content
- Edit existing popup cards
- Publish or unpublish popup cards
- View which users have seen each popup

#### Creating Popup Cards

When creating a popup card in the Nova admin panel, pay special attention to the **name** field:

1. The **name** field must be unique for each popup card
2. This name is used to reference the popup card in your code via the `->name()` method
3. The popup card must be created in the admin panel **before** it can be displayed in your code

For example, if you want to use `->name('2fa-reminder')` in your code, you must first create a popup card with the name "2fa-reminder" in the Nova admin panel.

#### User Interaction

The system will automatically show the latest active and published popup card to users when they access the page where the popup is configured. Users can:
- Close the popup card
- Choose to not see the popup again by checking the "Do Not Show Again" option
